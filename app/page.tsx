          My name is Tara Yazdian Anari, and I am currently pursuing a master
          degree in human-Computer Interaction at Utrecht University. I hold a
          Bachelor degree in Computer Engineering.

          My interests lie at the intersection of UX research, UI design, and
          psychology. After four years of studying programming and two years of
          working as a front-end developer, I discovered a strong passion for
          understanding peopleâ€”their behaviors, decision-making processes, and
          how they interact with technology. I became especially curious about
          how we can leverage this knowledge to enhance user experiences in
          everyday applications.
        </p>
        <p>
          Motivated by this interest, I returned to academia to deepen my
          understanding of human-technology interaction and research
          methodologies.
        </p>
        <p>
          I consider my strengths to be responsibility, adaptability, and a
          strong eagerness to continuously learn and grow.
